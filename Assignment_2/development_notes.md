# TODO

- change plotting for problem1 - network plot and fitness plot overlap
- adapt problem2 colour changing

## Problem1

- copied problem2_1 colour changing code and other stuff to problem1
- implemented common colours with neighbours for nodes.
- changed plotting wait time
- changed initialisation of graph to not use minimum colours, but still making nodes aware of only minimum colours

## Problem2_1

- deleted, no longer useful

## Problem2

- updated main function - might need to separate plotting of fitness and network
- copied over all relevant code from problem 1, minus the adaption of personality
