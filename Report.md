### Aoife Mulligan (20307646)

For this project I began by creating an initial, basic genetic algorithm. It didn't really work too well, so I went and did some research to understand it more. I realised that I wasn't fully understanding the crossover and mutation parts. Leo and I worked together to build the mutation parts then.
