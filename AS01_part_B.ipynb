    "Mutation swapping seems like the only way to do mutation - as in, the nature of the problem means we can't mutate without swapping.\n",
    "E.G. if n = 4 and two of our bins are: \\[1100\\] and \\[0011\\], we want to mutate only one chromosome. The first chromosome gets selected, so we flip the bit. Then we would have \\[0100\\] and \\[0011\\], but now the first item is not in a bin. We either must create an extra bin to place the first item (which seems crazy but I guess we could try), or we flip the corresponding bit in bin 2, so that the item is now in the other bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only difference between this basic example and our implementation is that our implementation will have many bins, and so when we want to swap a bit, we should randomly select the bin for it to be swapped to.\n",
